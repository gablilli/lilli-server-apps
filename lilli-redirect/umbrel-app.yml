  📸 Immich is a self-hosted solution for backing up, organizing, and managing your photos and videos. This app runs as a lightweight proxy inside Umbrel and redirects traffic to your existing Immich instance on your Seagate drive, allowing you to access your media through Umbrel without duplicating any data.

  This setup ensures that all your photos and videos remain on your external drive, while Umbrel sees Immich as a standard app. The proxy also displays the Immich logo and provides a simple redirect page for convenience.
